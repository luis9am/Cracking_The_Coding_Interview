# 2.1 Remove Dups:
# Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
#
# FOLLOW UP
# How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
#
# I   :
# D   :
# E\A :
# L   :

def remove_dup():
    print("..")


# 2.2 Return Kth to Last:
# Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.
#
# I   :
# D   :
# E\A :
# L   :

def kth_from_last():
    print("..")


# 2.3 Delete Middle Node:
# Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but
# the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to
# that node.
#
# Input: the node c from the linked list a - >b- >c - >d - >e- >f
# Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a - >b- >d - >e- >f
#
# I   :
# D   :
# E\A :
# L   :

def del_med():
    print("..")


# 2.4 Partition:
# Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come
# before all nodes greater than or equal to x. lf x is contained within the list, the values of x only need
# to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the
# "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
#
# Input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition = 5)
# Output: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
# Hints: #3, #24
#
# I   :
# D   :
# E\A :
# L   :

def kth_from_last():
    print("..")


# 2.5 Sum Lists: You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single
# digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1 's digit is at the head of the list. Write a
# function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
#
# Input: (7-) 1 -) 6) + (5 -) 9 -) 2) .Thatis,617 + 295.
# Output: 2 -) 1 -) 9. That is, 912.
#
# FOLLOW UP
# Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem.
#
# Input: (6 -) 1 -) 7) + (2 -) 9 -) 5).Thatis,617 + 295.
# Output: 9 -) 1 -) 2. That is, 912.
#
# I   :
# D   :
# E\A :
# L   :

def sum_lists():
    print("..")
